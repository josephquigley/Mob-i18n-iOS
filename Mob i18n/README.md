#  Mob Programming i18n

## Intro
The app works great in the USA! Let's make boocoos of money by selling it to the rest of the world.

This sample project includes a mock backend, and a front end that displays a user's summary, with the ability to change their profile.

## Problem 1
Our second customer is from Pakistan and can't sign up. Please fix it. He says his info is correct in his country and he really only has one name (no last name).

## Problem 2
Our third customer from Japan is royalty and doesn't have a last name. Or was that a first name? I don't know I'm unfamiliar with Japanese culture. Please help the former emperor update his mailing address, which he says is correct but his name and zip code are rejected.

## Problem 3
George is from across the pond in Birmingham, UK. He also can't sign up due what he claims is his "correct" zip code. Our support team suggested he restart his phone, but that didn't fix the issue.

## Problem 4
Ahmad bin... uhhmm. Ahmad called in from Libya very upset that his first names looks weird in our system and that he doesn't know what a zip code is because they don't use it over there. He also said there's not enough room to put his full name in.

## Problem 5
Some foreign dude whose name I can't pronounce or read told our team in flawless english that his name is backwards but that he put the first name in the first name box, and the last name in the last name box, so I don't know what he's smoking over there in Egypt.

## Problem 6
Everyone but Johnny says their temperature is wrong. Not sure why that is. The weather vendor probably got hacked.

## Problem 7
Hans called from Germany confused why his balance wrong, and that he doesn't need to know about the thousandth of a cent.

## Problem 8
Hans called back concerned that the bank fee is in dollars, but his balance is in euros and he doesn't want to pay the currency exchange fee. Our support team assured him that we charge fees in euros and we'll look into the issue.
